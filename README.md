  <h3>All algorithms implemented in Scala - for education</h3>
</div>

Implementations are for learning purposes only. As they may be less efficient than the implementations in the Scala
standard library, use them at your discretion.

## Getting Started

## How to use this repository for learning purpose ?

- [Download and install Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)
- Clone the repository on your local machine

  `git clone https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala.git`

- Open the repository using an IDE (Preferably IntelliJ Idea)

- Enable auto-import to import the dependencies from build.sbt
- Open the [src/main/scala](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/tree/master/src/main/scala) to view the algorithm
  implementations under various categories
- Open [src/test/scala](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/tree/master/src/test/scala) to run the test cases and
  view the algorithm in action
- Visit [Algorithms-Explained](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Algorithms-Explainations.git) to get a more detailed
  explanation about specific algorithms
- Check [Algorithms Visualization](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/blob/master/Algorithms%20Visualization.md) for
  visualization of numerous algorithms
